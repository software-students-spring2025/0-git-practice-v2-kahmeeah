## [Metaplay: Game development is entering a ‘Renaissance’](https://www.developer-tech.com/news/metaplay-game-development-entering-renaissance/)

An interesting article I found related to the Metaplay's report of a “Game Development Renaissance”

--- 

### My thoughts

Metaplay’s report on the “Game Development Renaissance” is a glimpse at how the gaming industry is evolving. It highlights how new technology, smarter tools, and fresh strategies are enabling game developers to create better games while overcoming recent challenges like rising costs and shifting player expectations. I found it particularly interesting how developers are focusing on long-term engagement with high-quality games, live service models, and cross-platform functionality. It also mentions 71% of developers anticipate healthier hiring trends in the future, with fewer layoffs and studio closures. It seems this "Game Development Renaissance" isn’t just about creating better games but also about building a more balanced industry where developers can thrive

### Input from another student

This article paints a bright outlook on the future of the gaming industry, crediting a surge in game quality, adoption of live service models, prioritizing cross-platform compatibility, technology and tooling advancements, and an increase in funding and publshing as being the driving forces behind the "Game Development Renaissance". What surprised me most is their comment on the live-service model: despite the overwhelming negativity surrounding the quality of these games, most (75%) in the industry view these "forever games" as positives and expect them to generate increased revenue in the new year. -- Jack Wang ([jackinthebox314](https://github.com/software-students-spring2025/0-git-practice-v2-JackInTheBox314.git))
